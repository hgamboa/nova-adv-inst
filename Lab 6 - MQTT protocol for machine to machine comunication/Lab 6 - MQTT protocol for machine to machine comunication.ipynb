    "### Learn about MQTT\n",
    "You can find a good MQTT tutorial in: http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/mqtt-basics-course/\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we are going to use the mosquitto implementation of the MQTT protocol. More details in: https://mosquitto.org/\n",

    "### Install MQTT services in the RPI\n",
    "To install the necessary MQTT services on your Raspberry Pi, open the terminal console and run the following commands:\n",
    "* sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients\n",

    "## Goal 1 - Publish and subscribe MQTT messages\n",
    "\n",
    "The MQTT is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol to share data between machines. Two actions are possible, send your data to a broker, by publishing it in a topic or receive it by subscribing a topic. So, to test your MQTT service you need the following information:\n",
    "* broker IP address – in the lab: 192.168.1.97 or 192.168.1.98\n",
    "* topic to be published or subscribed – Your choice, but it must be unique. \n",
    "* data load – could any data, but if it is binary data, it must be serialized in a string. For more information see json formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Publish data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open a termincal console in your RPI and run:\n",
    "  * mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.1.98 -t \"AAIB/g0/mytest\" -m \"Hello World\"\n",
    " \n",
    "This action has publisded the data \"Hello World\" in the topic \"AAIB/g0/mytest\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subscribe data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open a terminal console and subscribe the topic, by doing:\n",
    "   * mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.98 -v -t \"AAIB/g0/mytest/#\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Note 1: '#' means any subtopif of this topic\n",
    "Note 2: to terminate the subscription, do Ctrl-C\n",
    "\n",
    "* Publish more data, has you have done previously and confirm that you are receiving it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change topic\n",
    "\n",
    "As the broker is unique, if you topic is not unique, you can not distiguish the data  publish by you, from the other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change the topic, for someting unique to you.\n",
    "  * subscribe this new topic\n",
    "  * publish data in this new topic\n",

    "Final note: If you want, you can see the messages that are being generated by the other groups, if they are kind enough to give you the topic where they are publishing. "

    "\n",
    "In goal 2.1, the RPI only has the capability to publish data and the PC to subscribe. In a more real scenario, it is often necessary that both machines, PC and RPI, to be able to publish and subscribe simultaneously. That introduce a new layer of complexity, due to the subscribe data could reach the machine at any time, so it necessary to have some ability to do multithreading (running diferent tasks/threads at same time).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s assume the following scenario:\n",
    "* The PC publish the character \"s\" in the topic: \"AAIB/anything/cmd\" (replace anything with a string that uniquely intentify you)\n",

    "  * it generated a list of 10 random numbers\n",
    "  * publish the list in the topic: \"AAIB/anything/data\" (replace anything with a string that uniquely intentify you)\n",
