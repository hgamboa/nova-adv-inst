# Lab 7 - Visualization


## Requirements

* Install bokeh via pip or via the full anaconda distribuition
* Install nova instrumentation


## Starting steps

* Test simple graph on ipython notebook

## Lab Goals

## Goal 1 - Transfer function of a low pass

* Plot the DB of the transfer function of the gain in a frequency log scale.

|H| = 1/sqrt(1 + (f/f_c)^2)

* Plot the phase of the transfer function in degrees in a frequency log scale.

phase(H) = -2 arctan(f/f_c)


## Goal 2 - Random walk

* Plot a random walk (1000 samples)
* Plot the mean sliding window (using ni.smooth, with 50 samples window).
* Plot the variance band.
* Draw multiples superimposed random walks.

## Goal 3 - XY Graph

* Draw a xy graph of a sin(w) and cos(2w)
* Adjust the axis to be a square figure
* Place 9 lissajous figures in subplots

## Goal 4 - Matrix images

* Create a matrix of zeros and draw a circle 
by turning some points to 1
* Smooth the image with a vertical smooth by passing in each column.
* Smooth the image with a vertical smooth and horizontal pass.


## Report - :red_circle: Until Friday 20:00 of your remote lecture

* Submit a pdf in moodle with a screenshot of all 4 plots
